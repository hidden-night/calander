#Calander - linux commandline

This is a pure C++ programme to display calander of the given date in the terminal.

In the calander the day is highlighted using linux colour code. So for other platforms the colour code will not work as expected (so remove it if needed from the print function of calander class in calander.cpp)!

##Installation and running

Clone the repository and compile the C++ code.

'''
git clone https://github.com/silent-dusk/calander
cd calander
g++ calander-main.cpp calander.cpp -o calander
./calander
'''
